We are interested in parametrizing the loss through our objective as a function of distance from center (by offset from galvos). We will do this via the following steps.

 - Calibrate mV -> um for the galvos.
   + Galvoscan on square on calibration sample (collecting red),
   + Piezoscan at same place,
   + Use the size of the square to get a calibration.
 - Aquire data.
   + Galvoscan on calibration sample (collecting green) with very wide range.

First, we find the center of the calibration sample:

 - Corner 1 = 		[ 19486.2, 20055.7 ]
 - Corner 2 = 		[ 19698.3, 21375.3 ]
 - Implies Center = 	[ 19592.2, 20715.5 ]
 
We take a piezoscan at the center (forgot to save). We then center on the square that is in view and scan again (20_05_50_251). Next, we galvoscan (20_14_18_024) We cannot clearly see the square; the range is lower than expected. We move above the square and piezoscan again (20_19_42_655).

Whoops! This microscope is not like Brynn's Microscope; I was imaging the pinhole rather than the square...
